# TalentHub
A platform for people to share skills and ask questions.
It encourages people to write short articles that can be reused between other articles, each article should aim for a specific question, made through TalentHub or anywhere, making heavy use of links to another articles or to other websites even.

### Here's what makes TalentHub unique

- **Micro-learning articles:** We believe in bite-sized knowledge. Craft concise, focused articles answering specific questions raised on TalentHub or anywhere else.
- **Reusable content:** Build upon existing knowledge. Articles can reference and link to each other, creating a rich and interconnected learning ecosystem.
- **Curated resources:** Don't reinvent the wheel! Link to helpful external resources like websites, tutorials, or even other TalentHub articles, providing users with comprehensive information.
- **Empowerment through learning:** Ask questions, share your expertise, and contribute to a collaborative learning environment.

### How TalentHub works

It's divided into 2 main sections: **Posts** and **Questions**, as the name implies, you can make questions in the Questions section that people can answer in the Posts section, simple as that.

TalentHub supports **Markdown** with external images (as URLs), and if you don't know what markdown is, don't worry, check out [this quick cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/).
